## Core Features:

- AI Trash Classification: Utilize the Gemini API with image recognition tool to classify the type of trash as either organic or inorganic based on visual data from the camera module.
- Dashboard Summary: Provide a dashboard view summarizing total trash collected (organic vs. inorganic) for specified time periods.
- Event Logging with Image: Log individual trash disposal events, noting the time, classification (organic/inorganic), and a thumbnail image from the camera. Viewable in reverse chronological order.
- Data Visualization: Provide clear, user-friendly visualizations to differentiate between the types of waste, e.g., through graphs or charts.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 210, 67%, 46% (RGB Hex: #2684FF) conveys a sense of reliability, order, and cleanliness suitable for data presentation.
- Background color: HSL 210, 15%, 95% (RGB Hex: #F0F8FF) offers a clean, light backdrop that complements the primary color and reduces visual fatigue.
- Accent color: HSL 180, 50%, 50% (RGB Hex: #40BFBF) is used for interactive elements, providing contrast and clarity.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) offers a modern, tech-forward feel, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) is used for body text to ensure readability of the logged data.
- Simple, clear icons will represent organic and inorganic waste types. Use a consistent style across the dashboard.
- A card-based layout will display the most relevant information clearly and intuitively.
